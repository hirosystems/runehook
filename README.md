# API Documentation

For instructions to run the REST API or endpoint reference, take a look at the [API README](./api/README.md).

# Quick Start

## System Requirements

To run runehook, you will need:

1. A fully synchronized Bitcoin node.
1. A local writeable Postgres database for data storage.
   * We recommended a 1TB volume size.

## Indexing Runes

1. Clone the repo.

1. Create an `.env` file and specify the appropriate values to configure the local
API server, postgres DB and Ordhook node reachability. See
[`env.ts`](https://github.com/hirosystems/ordinals-api/blob/develop/src/env.ts)
for all available configuration options.

1. Build the app (NodeJS v18+ is required)
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

1. Start the service
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

### Stopping the API

When shutting down, you should always prefer to send the `SIGINT` signal instead
of `SIGKILL` so the service has time to finish any pending background work and
all dependencies are gracefully disconnected.

# Bugs and feature requests
